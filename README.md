To play the game use the left,right, up and down arrow keys to navigate from the bottom row to the top row.  When you get to the top you will be sent back to the bottom row and your level will advance.   You have three lives to gain as many levels as possible.  If hit by an enemy bug you will lose a life.  Have fun.
